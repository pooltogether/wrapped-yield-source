# PoolTogether Wrapped Yield Source

Wraps any [PoolTogether Yield Source](https://docs.pooltogether.com/protocol/yield-sources) with batching and reserve capture functionality.

Batching reduces gas costs considerably, although the batch needs to be run by someone.

Reserve allows the protocol to capture a percentage of the tokens.
